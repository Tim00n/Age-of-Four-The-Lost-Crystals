# Age-of-Four-The-Lost-Crystals
An HD 2d RPG game I'm working on during my free time. Solo project so far.

The combat would be turn based. I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything. There would be 4 heroes who set out to find a total of 5 crystals across the world. The four heroes each have their own class:
1. Physically Ranged (Anti air, good damage, weak defense and health)
2. Special Ranged (Anti air, good against armored enemies, decent special defense, poor health)
3. Melee (good health and attack, horrid defense)
4. Tactical (a mixed bag supporter that can apply status effects or boosts and hits multiple enemies at once)

The classes themselves are fixed, but throughout the game and the completition of quests you can upgrade each hero with different gears. The gears could also reskin them depending on when and in which area you buy them.

Ideas for a story will be posted soon, as I'm still writing up a rough draft and script.
